The questions are solved in the following notebooks

| Question | Description |
| :--- | :---- |
| [Question 1](./questions/Question%201%20-%201D%20SLAM.ipynb) | 1D SLAM: Example from [Notion](https://saishubodh.notion.site/Solved-Example-1D-SLAM-weighted-LS-Illustrating-Sparsity-in-SLAM-d8b45893843b4377b07b1d4aa1aab4de) |
| [Question 2](./questions/Question%202%20-%202D%20SLAM.ipynb) | 2D SLAM: The pose-graph optimization / SLAM problem, entailing only localization (path) side of SLAM. Achieved a non-optimal (probably locally optimal) solution. |
| [Question 3](./questions/Question%203%20-%20Trajectory%20Evaluation%20and%20g2o.ipynb) | Trajectory Evaluation using [Evo](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo) and optimization using [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) |
| [Question 4](./questions/Question%204%20-%20General%20Questions.ipynb) | General questions |

## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run the notebooks can be created using [anaconda-env.yml](./anaconda-env.yml).

It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also. All equations were created using [codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) and the rendering was tested and verified on VSCode.
