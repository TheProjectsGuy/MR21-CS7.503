    "The project deals with the **Localization** aspect of SLAM, using an optimization problem (_pose graph optimization_). Here, the vertices (states) were given, and they had to be optimized using odometry and loop closure constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other part is **Mapping** and it deals with tracking the pose of landmarks in a map (usually a global coordinate system). This entails adding state vectors of each landmark and successively updating their estimated position using a filter (like Bayes filter or a Kalman Filter). Usually, these new states (landmarks) have no motion model (they're assumed to be fixed in the global frame). SLAM entails simultaneous optimization (or finding) of both the position(s) of the robot in global frame (**localization**) and the pose of landmarks in the global frame (**mapping**).\n"

One approach could be to keep a track of a certain number of features that have very less noise in detection. These could also be cross-checked with some loop-closure algorithms (if there is a loop closure, you would also expect similar landmarks to be around). \n",
