## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run the notebooks can be created using [anaconda-env.yml](./anaconda-env.yml).

It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also. All equations were created using [codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) and the rendering was tested and verified on VSCode.

## Data

This assignment uses data from [grail.cs.washington.edu](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal/data/). You may download the files from here (for the bundle adjustment notebook)

These files, being bulky, aren't included in the submission

Additionally, some pickle files can be found on OneDrive [here](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/avneesh_mishra_research_iiit_ac_in/EhbQEbl8_BFFg0tFmVb1oj0BlJUc1ENyMC9ZomBPAJlOTg?e=CoLPYF) (IIITH login required). These are just backups (in case for verification), they aren't needed for the main program execution.
