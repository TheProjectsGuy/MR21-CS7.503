## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run the notebooks can be created using [anaconda-env.yml](./anaconda-env.yml).

It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also. All equations were created using [codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) and the rendering was tested and verified on VSCode.
