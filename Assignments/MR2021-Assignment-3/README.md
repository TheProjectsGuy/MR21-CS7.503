The submission can be found in the [Assignment-3.ipynb](./Assignment-3.ipynb) file. The specific results, if any needed, are stored in the [results](./results/) folder. Everything is done mostly in the notebook.

## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run this notebook can be created using [anaconda-env.yml](./results/anaconda-env.yml) file (in results).

It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also. All equations were created using [codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) and the rendering was tested and verified on VSCode.

## Resources

- The point cloud for bunny is stored in [./resources/bunny.ply](./resources/bunny.ply)
- The [./helpers/func.py](./helpers/func.py) was provided with the material. This is not altered in any significant way (the functions are the same as were given).
