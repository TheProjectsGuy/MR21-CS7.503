The submission can be found in [Assignment4.ipynb](./Assignment4.ipynb) file. The specific results, if any needed, as well as backups of the results (for point correspondences, corners, etc.) are stored in [results](./results/) folder. Everything is contained mostly in the notebook.

## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run this notebook can be created using [anaconda-env.yml](./results/anaconda-env.yml) file (in results).

It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also. All equations were created using [codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) and the rendering was tested and verified on VSCode.
