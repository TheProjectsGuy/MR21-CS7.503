The submission can be found in the [Assignment-1.ipynb](./Assignment-1.ipynb) file. The specific results, if any needed, are stored in the [results](./results/) folder. Everything is done mostly in the notebook.

## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run this notebook can be created using [anaconda-env.yml](./results/anaconda-env.yml) file (in results).

It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also. All equations were created using [codecogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) and the rendering was tested and verified on VSCode.
